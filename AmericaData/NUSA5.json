You earn money by landing on property squares with investment opportunities, like a sushi restaurant in Ginza or an animation goods store in Akihabara. After you invest, you’ll have to wait until March rolls around for those investments to pay off. In the meantime, be on the lookout for errant monsters that may shower you with riches...or throw a wrench in your plans! You can also earn extra money by landing on item squares, which can either help you reach your own goals or simply ruin your rivals’ plans. If you finish the game with the most money...you win!1. Brains, Bravado, and Lucky Breaks! Dice and random events will help decide your fate...but you’ll also need to invest wisely, take calculated risks, and rely on the whims of unpredictable monsters if you want to become Japan’s next billionaire!2. Over 30 items and 50 monsters! You’ll encounter dozens of items and monsters, each with their own effects. Use them to push your opponents around, ruin their investments, and generally make their lives miserable. But be careful, because while they may help you earn money and pull ahead, they can also make bad purchases or investments on your behalf. This can change the game at a moment’s notice, so study the monsters well to make sure you know when to walk away, and when to run!3. Multiple Modes Means Maximum Mayhem! Tournament Mode is a single-player version that lasts for 30 in-game years, while Skirmish Mode is a quick multiplayer experience that lasts a mere 36 months. Whether long or short-term, it’s sure to get the adrenaline pumping!4. Show Your Friends Who’s Boss! Play with your buddies locally!5. There are hidden playable maps like the Monster Island.6.

It’s like the game wants you to do well (while it’s throwing spikes at you).* Choose your own route to completion through a non-linear map. Stuck on a super-tough stage? No worries! Just go and hone your skills on a different level.* Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, we’re going to keep saying it's funny. You'll come around eventually. (Don’t worry there is no extra charge if you laugh more than ten times.)(No controllers were harmed in the making of this game.)","game_category":"Platformer, Puzzle, Arcade","release_date":"2017-09-28","agerating":"e","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Ant Workshop","developer":"Ant Workshop","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian","required_space":"686 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/binaries-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":206},{"name":"Binarystar Infinity","nameEn":"Binarystar Infinity","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/binarystar-infinity-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$4.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000036478","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Binarystar Infinity is a 1-Bit Shoot ‘Em Up with a challenging experience reminding of the traditional Arcade Shmup classics, that can be experienced alone or with a friend, and with the particularity of being playable in vertical or horizontal scrolling mode.

\"Blaster Master\" from Sunsoft as a base, Blaster Master Zero has many new additions, such as new areas and bosses, new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons, improved gameplay, a more robust scenario, refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more.\n\nIn the near future on Earth, a young man named Jason Frudnick boards the battle vehicle SOPHIA III and sets off on an adventure in the subterranean depths of the planet.\n\nOn the side-view maps, take control of SOPHIA III and explore your surroundings as you search for the entrance to the dungeon where the area's boss lurks.\n\nOnce you find the dungeon entrance, exit SOPHIA III and make your way inside as Jason and take on the mutants inside in top-down mode.\n\nDefeat the mid-bosses and area bosses to acquire new items, sub-weapons, upgrades to SOPHIA III and Jason's equipment, and new abilities and move to the next area.\n\nWhat awaits Jason at the end of his long adventure...?","game_category":"Adventure,
