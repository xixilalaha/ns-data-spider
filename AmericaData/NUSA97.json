Dragging your bloody tentacles on the greasy asphalt, you snatch body after body. You are the HyperParasite; an evil alien with a bone to pick with humanity…just because it’s fun. Infesting the sickest corners of the most ass-kicking decade, you must fight your way to the top of the pop-cultural food chain, in order to push the Big Red Button and bring about the mushroom cloud of finality. Be the baddest, navigating the dangerous procedurally generated streets of a hopeless past, in this tough twin-stick roguelite brawling S.O.B.'Long live the new flesh'Look at all those juicy meat-sacks going to waste on those grotty humans! As the HyperParasite you can make better use of them, snatching hosts with your tentacles, absorbing them and their different abilities. Once they die you can discard their skin, but keep on snatching, since one shot as the parasite and it's permadeath. That is, unless you found some nice upgrades, so keep your eyes open…or your feelers high...or whatever a parasite does.'Hosting makes me feel good'Feed the parasite with over 60 different characters, as you collect and control hosts, each with their own unique attack and smack-down. Hunt down the host class boss, rip their brain off (they didn´t use it anyway), and take it back to Wito's, our ever-greedy shopkeeper. Using some very weird machinery to store the brain, you can then unlock the character with your hard stolen cash. There's even a storage unit for your already collected hosts to come back to in later games.'Yeah, Downtown must be the friendliest place on Earth...'Since the game is procedurally generated, nobody knows what's waiting around the next dark corner. Can you survive the 5 Acts of this grungy-looking synthwave-filled world? Maybe yes, if you remember that what lies in the shadows is essential, as there are secrets within secrets to explore within its roguelite mapping system. And if you keep a tentacle out for the bosses, as they pack one mean punch!Pump up the volume!Original beats served by Van Reeves and Joe Kataldo, delivering a thumping score with a pulsating synthwave bassline, punctuating every snatch and kill.A friend in need...Trouble loves company, as you can bring a mate to deliver twice the carnage in two-player local co-op mode.

While fast paced action goes you will also have to consider some strategy, assigning your partner primary objectives to shoot down, in order to succeed. Iron Wings is primarily and arcade game, a flying shooter, where shooting won't be enough, where each weapon or tool mounted on each of the two planes will have its role on completing each mission, and you'll have to deal with the decision on what to do and how to do it. During flight, you will control both pilots and their plane, switching between them anytime you need, and assigning orders to the other one. Each of the two planes you will pick will carry different extra tools to be used during the mission. Extra tools as Chaffs and Magnetron as radar countermeasures, Photo Camera to report detailed visuals of some objectives, Search Light to discover and focus targets on night scenarios and more to discover. Wise choice of camouflages will also influence your visibility to enemies, and consequentially will help you avoid some damages. Iron Wings follows the story of two childhood friends who join the war in a special air force squadron. Under the guidance of Colonel David Ruse, their objective is to locate and stop the general Adler ahead of the 'Ahnenerbe', a secret team of Nazi archaeologists and scientists. Game starts during a fund raising in NY and rapidly moving into war operations with the Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily) following the real events in the search for Adler. Pilots will face aerial and ground missions from NY, rebuilt in deep detail as in the ‘40s, and other USA locations as Black Canyon, to many of the real battlefields along Europe, from Sicily to Naples passing through Poland and Germany.","game_category":"Arcade, Action, Action","release_date":"2020-06-25","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Naps Team","developer":"Naps Team","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian","required_space":"1.9 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/i/iron-wings-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","type":"image"}],"idx":4819},{"name":"ISLAND","nameEn":"ISLAND","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/island-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$59.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000035735","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"With a story by G.O. and art by Kuuchuu yousai, the PC gaming brand Frontwing presents the popular sci-fi romance-adventure series ISLAND.\nThe secret of this world is uncovered through scattered keywords and masterful foreshadowing in this magnificent telling of an epic tale.\nA full cast of talented voice actors delivers this fantastical tale of an island with a complicated past that's on its way to desolation.\n\nThe visual novel \"Tomorrow is the big day\" included!\nEnjoy the epilogue once you beat the main game and meet all of the requirements.\n\nAvailable in two languages!\nThe text can be set to Japanese or English (audio is Japanese only).
