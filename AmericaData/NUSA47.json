Add to that a coup d’etat within one of these houses – instigated by an invading alien army – and Avalice’s future is looking grim.Enter, our three unlikely protagonists: the dragon, Sash Lilac, who unwittingly gets involved when she witnesses a strange airship crash-land and grows concerned for the well-being of its pilot; the wildcat, Carol Tea, whose dedication to her best friend leads her to undertake whatever challenges fate throws her way; and the orphaned puppy, Milla Basset, whose quest for nothing more than mere companionship inadvertently brings her directly into the line of fire.Together, this trio of anthropomorphized heroines must somehow ingratiate themselves to each of the three houses, stop an all-out alien invasion, and learn the secret nature of the Kingdom Stone before its power wanes…and before a world war breaks out around them.Freedom Planet is a fast-paced combat-driven platform adventure that pits a spunky dragon girl and her friends against hostile foreign powers and alien attack forces. There's trouble around every turn, from insects to giant robots to sheer explosive destruction, but players will have a variety of special fighting abilities at their disposal to blast through more than a dozen massive, nonlinear stages. The campaign may be played through as Lilac, Carol, or the unlockable Milla, each of whom has completely unique gameplay mechanics, an altered story mode in which the selected character takes the lead, and even a few of her own unique stages.KEY FEATURESGorgeous 2D pixel art with meticulous detail and a grand, rocking soundtrackLush multi-scrolling backdrops are layered behind minutely detailed stages, each populated with a variety of lovingly animated characters and most backed by at least two unique music tracks per stage, along with unique music for almost every boss battle.Three playable characters with completely different strengths and abilitiesUse Lilac’s dragon powers to hair-whip enemies, spin like a cyclone, or blaze through the skies like a comet; use Carol’s feline agility to cut through foes with punches and kicks, scale walls, or summon a gravity-defying motorcycle; and use Milla’s mighty basset-hound ears to fly short distances, or call upon her canine magic to create deadly cubes which can be tossed at foes, compressed into a directional shield, or fired off as if from a rifle.Momentum-based platforming and combat in a wide variety of settingsUse the game’s tight controls to reach incredible speeds and heights, exploring massive stages full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden collectibles.

Always be prepared to make a timely exit when things start getting hairy.","game_category":"Action, Arcade, Strategy","release_date":"2020-10-06","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Tentacle Head Games","developer":"Tentacle Head Games","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English","required_space":"184 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050621","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050621","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050621","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050621","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050621","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050621","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/from-orbit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050621","type":"image"}],"idx":2332},{"name":"Full Metal Furies","nameEn":"Full Metal Furies","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/full-metal-furies-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$19.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000012204","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"From the creators of Rogue Legacy comes a \"true-cooperative\" action RPG.

The deeper an explorer goes into the caverns, the more valuable gemstones that can be found, however at the risk of facing more of the dangerous and hostile creatures that live there, including creatures that are larger than life.Armed only with a gun, explorers must break through rocks to collect minerals and gemstones and fight off the creatures, and find the portal that can help them go back up to sell what they collect or go further down.Gemstone Keeper uses ASCII art in both a pure and diverse form, as almost every part of the game's look come directly from text and symbols while very loose in form.

Talk to the denizens of Dwindling Heights, make allies of your enemies, and leave no stone unturned in your quest to find Merra.","game_category":"Adventure, Puzzle, Action, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-10-08","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Plug In Digital","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian","required_space":"2.1 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/ghost-of-a-tale-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":2349}]
