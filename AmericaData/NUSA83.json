Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina’s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.Both Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?●Features– Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl.– 4+n difficulty settings for all types of players.– 9+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore.– Bunny.– Over 60 items and upgrades.– Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations.– 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row.– Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character.– Over 50+ pieces from an original soundtrack.– English, Chinese and Japanese support.– Bunny.","game_category":"Action, Adventure, Role-Playing","release_date":"2019-10-17","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"CIRCLE Entertainment","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, English","required_space":"715 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":false,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rabi-ribi-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4118},{"name":"Rack N Ruin","nameEn":"Rack N Ruin","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rack-n-ruin-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$12.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000014479","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Join Rack on an epic adventure across a world filled with magic and wonder.

If you're lucky, you can bring down multiple foes with a single shot.■ Gunkata: Fire double-handed pistols at random with a cool pose.-Stage Types■ Normal Stage: All you have to do is wipe out enemies. It's the ideal type of stage for earning coins.■ Death Race Stage: Within a time limit, you have to exterminate zombies on the map with a zombie car.■ Baseball Stage: You have to stop the zombies rushing to home with baseballs.■ Barricade Stage: You have to stop the zombies trying to get through the barricade.■ Escort Stage: You have to escort survivors to the escape point.■ Big Escape Stage: You have to drive a tank to the escape point while defeating the enemies swarming upon you.■ Boss Stage: Zombie's Cool features five bosses who possess varied patterns.-Coins and UpgradesOnce you upgrade your weapons' and the player's abilities, stages you once thought were difficult will be able to be cleared with ease. All upgrade elements within the game are carried out using coins.You can earn more and more coins the higher your combo chain number, which rises as you kill enemies, goes. Be careful though, the chain is broken if you are attacked by an enemy or if a set amount of time passes without you killing an enemy.That doesn't sound very easy, you say? Well then, maybe you should try replaying the previous stage a few times to collect some money then upgrade your weapons.If you do that, then at some point, you'll be able to enjoy the experience of having coins gush forth suddenly.Coins can solve anything in this game!Just be sure to remember to maintain your combo chain by not letting enemies attack you!-Multiple Round ElementsSo you've seen the first round ending?Then you should try the Normal and Hard difficulties too, where even stronger zombies and bosses are awaiting you.Thanks to diverse zombies risking life and death to fling themselves at you from an early phase, you'll be able to experience a different feeling then you did when you played the Easy difficulty.-Enemy Types■ Walker: Moving at a sluggish pace, it's ready to become a good source of coins for the player.■ Rusher: Once it approaches a certain distance, it goes mad chasing after the player.■ Smasher: It's not only great at taking blows, it's also got great attack power and mobility.■ Eater: It's the slowest moving of all the zombie types, but also the strongest against attacks, so it will soak up all the bullets you throw at it like a sponge, leaving you with no ammo left.■ Helldog: It's the weakest against attacks, but it leaps all over the place, making the player busy just keeping up with it.■ Crawler: It crawls around on the ground while shooting out scary acidic spit, requiring a continuous exercise of judgment and control from the player.-Wait just a second...Did you just say you don't think you can handle playing, because of all the different enemies?This isn't the first time I'm telling you this, but when you feel like that, you should discuss things with some coins.Coins can solve any problem you'll run into in this game!","game_category":"Adventure, Action, Arcade","release_date":"2020-11-12","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"GAME MUSEUM","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English","required_space":"214 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":false,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050622","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050622","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050622","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050622","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050622","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050622","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/z/zombies-cool-switch/screenshot-gallery/zombies-cool-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050622","type":"image"}],"idx":4126},{"name":"Zombie Scrapper","nameEn":"Zombie Scrapper","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/zombie-scrapper-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$2.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000018983","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Zombie Scrapper is a twin stick shooter that will test your survival skills!
