Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.\n\nSIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE\nOvercooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a\nwell-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!\n\nWith Nintendo Switch HD Rumble, become immersed in the crazy culinary antics like never before.\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY\nWhether indulging in deep fried local co-op or sautéed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.\n\nJust like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends! Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con™ controllers and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy-Con controllers or two Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers™ and you can play with up to four players for even more frantic fun.\n\nYou’ll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!\n","game_category":"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Communication, Party","release_date":"2017-07-27","agerating":"e","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Team17","developer":null,"no_of_players":"up to 4 players","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, English","required_space":"990 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/overcooked-special-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050701","type":"image"}],"idx":1761},{"name":"Out of Space: Couch Edition","nameEn":"Out of Space: Couch Edition","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/out-of-space-couch-edition-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000029906","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"You and your friends are about to move into a house in space, where you will have to deal with a deadly alien infestation and face the challenges of building a sustainable spaceship, all to make your new place feel as cozy as home!COUCH FUN MEETS STRATEGYEach match starts in a procedurally generated spaceship house that will demand your best planning and teamwork skills to become clean and comfy.

The quicker you are, the more points you score. As the Vormwall speed increases, so does the challenge. Play in Marathon Mode, where you simply have to last as long as you can, or take on Blitz Mode and get as many points as possible in a set time limit. Technically you could play forever in Marathon Mode and thanks to Nintendo Switch’s portability, bathroom breaks needn’t ruin your High Score attempt.Do you have a friend? Or an enemy you want to embarrass? Good! Challenge them in the competitive modes and discover who really is the Omvorm Champion of your particular house or workplace. Enough talk. Time to get comfortable, let the glorious soundtrack wash over you and PLAY SOME OMVORM!","game_category":"Puzzle, Arcade","release_date":"2018-09-18","agerating":"e","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"4MB Interactive","developer":"4MB Interactive","no_of_players":"up to 2 players","supported_languages":"English","required_space":"181 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/o/omvorm-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","type":"image"}],"idx":1778},{"name":"OmoTomO","nameEn":"OmoTomO","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/omotomo-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000027283","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"This game not only provides a relaxing experience with a zen garden environment, but also challenges players with a variety of puzzles, whilst experiencing the growth of the OmoTomO creature.

As we first learn about numbers, our minds create the so-called mental numeric axis. It is the way the human mind arranges numbers in space in relation to each other. It is the basis of all mathematics further on and… it can be trained! As you move your finger on the control panel in Numbala, or move your JoyCon, your mind creates a connection between a number and its position in space. Thus, your ability to add and subtract numbers is being improved without you even noticing the process.The game has been designed in cooperation with neuroscientists and tested on more than one hundred children.
