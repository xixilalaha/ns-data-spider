The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology.DESCRIPTION:Alder's Blood is a dark, stealth, tactical game with the turn-based combat focused on avoiding enemy ambushes and setting up your own. Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay.Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival.Monsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it.Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will.Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used.And smaller ones, better for stealth actions. Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.In addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp.Remember, this is not the world you know.This is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology.Your resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.","game_category":"Adventure, Action, Strategy, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-03-13","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"No Gravity Games","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Spanish, Russian","required_space":"1.8 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/alders-blood-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":3224},{"name":"Along the Edge","nameEn":"Along the Edge","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/along-the-edge-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$16.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000027852","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Daphné is at a dead-end.

As you fight through the levels, unveil the ambitions of the Slime monster...This is possibly the most unexpected underdog-hero fantasy simulation RPG you will ever play!","game_category":"Adventure, Simulation, Strategy, Role-Playing","release_date":"2018-01-18","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Flyhigh Works","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, Chinese","required_space":"55 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/ambition-of-the-slimes-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050611","type":"image"}],"idx":3229},{"name":"Among the Sleep - Enhanced Edition","nameEn":"Among the Sleep - Enhanced Edition","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/among-the-sleep-enhanced-edition-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$24.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000015055","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"In the enhanced edition of this award-winning first person horror adventure, you step into the pyjamas of a two year old child creeping through a dark and distorted house.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles.Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area.Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far.The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","game_category":"Action, Role-Playing, Arcade, Fighting","release_date":"2019-01-03","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"TROOOZE","developer":"TROOOZE, INC.","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, German, Spanish, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese","required_space":"2.7 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/animus-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","type":"image"}],"idx":3236},{"name":"ANIMUS: Harbinger","nameEn":"ANIMUS: Harbinger","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-harbinger-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$7.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000024833","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker’s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.
