As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n• The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n• You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.\n\n• Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n• Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.\n","game_category":"Adventure, First-Person, Action, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-06-05","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Private Division","developer":"Obsidian Entertainment","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, English","required_space":"13.8 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-outer-worlds-switch/screenshot-gallery/the-outer-worlds-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050701","type":"image"}],"idx":5053},{"name":"The Park","nameEn":"The Park","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-park-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000019522","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Set in a creepy amusement park hiding a dark and sinister secret, The Park is a one to two hour long first-person psychological horror experience focusing on intense storytelling and exploration instead of combat and action.A day at the park... a lost teddy bear... a missing child.

While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter’s focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.","game_category":"Adventure","release_date":"2019-08-15","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"The Astronauts","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, German, Italian, Spanish, English","required_space":"2.2 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","type":"image"}],"idx":5060},{"name":"The Walking Dead: A New Frontier","nameEn":"The Walking Dead: A New Frontier","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-walking-dead-a-new-frontier-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000011822","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"When family is all you have left…how far will you go to protect it?After society was ripped apart by undead hands, pockets of civilization emerge from the chaos.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\n---------\n\nThis War of Mine: Complete Edition consists of:\n• This War of Mine – full version of the base game\n• Anniversary Edtion update – set of new characters to interact with, locations to explore and new possible ending, created especially for the second anniversary of the game\n• The Little Ones DLC – exploring the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective – that of a child.\n• This War of Mine Stories - the full set of three new stories set in the world of This War of Mine.

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage...Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.","game_category":"First-Person, Action, Arcade, Strategy","release_date":"2020-05-07","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Humble Games","developer":"Blue Manchu","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, English","required_space":"3.1 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/void-bastards-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","type":"image"}],"idx":5095},{"name":"Waifu Uncovered","nameEn":"Waifu Uncovered","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/waifu-uncovered-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$6.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000029570","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Eight beautiful maidens are under threat of alien attack.

Step into their shoes and experience travel from distinct perspectives. Wanderlust Travel Stories is a book that you shape. If you’re seeking something a little bit different it is for you—and if you can read this, you have all you need to get started. Four long stories and five short ones, each written by its own team of authors. Every journey offers a unique playstyle as you experience travel through the eyes of distinct individuals. Like an idealistic student, a jaded reporter, or a man who’s simply a terrible planner.Inspired by true stories and set in real places. Travel to the mysterious statues of Rapa Nui, bustling streets of Bangkok, pristine expanses of the Antarctic, grasslands of the Serengeti, and more. Dive into tales created by passionate travelers and experienced reporters, see the world they saw throughout their journeys.Your choices shape the characters’ mood. This, in turn, changes how you see the world. All emotions are valid: happiness or enthusiasm aren’t everything, feeling sad or fatigued is perfectly natural.Tasteful aesthetic, bespoke photography, and immersive soundscapes set the tone. Just enough to stir your own memories or feed the imagination.Like a peaceful afternoon with a cup of tea and a novel, it’s a slow-paced and meditative experience. You don’t have to rush or fight, you can take in every moment at your own pace. If this is what you seek, we introduce to you what we call Slow Gaming.","game_category":"Adventure, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-02-27","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Forever Entertainment","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English","required_space":"1.5 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/wanderlust-travel-stories-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","type":"image"}],"idx":5097},{"name":"Warframe","nameEn":"Warframe","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/warframe-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$0.00","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000009425","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"CHOOSE YOUR WARFRAMEWith more than 30 Warframes, each fully customizable with their own unique abilities, you can create the perfect Warframe for you.
