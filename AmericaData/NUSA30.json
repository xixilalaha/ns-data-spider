The tactics in the game are in the resource management, and the placement and type of factories. Factories poop out minions that will find their way to the opposing buildings and destroy them. Once you destroy the enemy base, you win. simple.\n\nDon't just watch, join!\nRover Wars has a neat local multiplayer system. It allows up to 8 users to join the game. To avoid couch conflicts we implemented some brilliant AI to battle cooperatively. There are always 2 teams and each side has a maximum of 4 Rovers, during battle players can even switch teams or hire some AI.\n\nBesides the campaign there is also the battle mode. This allows you to battle in one of the 17 instantly available maps.
