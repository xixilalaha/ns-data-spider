Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system.Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on “The Wall Show”, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems.FEATURES* Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them.* Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game’s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs.* Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas. You’ll have to interact with the environment itself to solve most of the puzzles: use the protagonist’s momentum to move platforms, flip the occasional lever, and sometimes you might have to sacrifice an NPC or two to cross a particularly spiky pit.* Story and Personality: Featuring lots of impish humor, Grade A sarcasm, and comic mischief, all balanced perfectly with the dark, heavy themes presented in this dystopian world.","game_category":"Platformer, Adventure, Action, Puzzle","release_date":"2020-04-30","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Hitcents","developer":"Ministry of Broadcast Studios","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese","required_space":"2.0 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/m/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4861},{"name":"Minoria","nameEn":"Minoria","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/minoria-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$19.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000027080","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Ink and blood stain the streets of Ramezia.

The body count rises, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit. You are a taxi driver and survivor to the killer’s most recent attacks, having barely escaped with your life. You have seven nights to help find the killer, or the police will pin it on you. These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or safe… Night Call is a non-linear, narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories… their secrets. To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a confidant, a counselor. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real lives throughout the City of Light. And you’ll need to play these roles well if you want to catch the killer. Use the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning money to pay your bills. Drive passengers to their destinations, hear their stories and choose your responses carefully—some are just regular people with a tale to tell, while others might reveal a clue that’s key to your investigation. Follow the right leads to uncover new info about the suspects, and don’t forget to make enough money to buy gas and pay your bills. Can you solve the mystery before it’s too late? Better hurry—both the clock and the meter are running…KEY FEATURES:A VIVID AND ORIGINAL CAST: Meet more than 70 original, surprising, realistic characters and share their lives for a few brief moments.

Now Steve and his expanding roster of dubious heroes must wield their unique skills to shoot, slide, dive, and take cover behind a political platform built on ethics, accountability, and an inordinate amount of gunfire. Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city’s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. Through the power of ISO-Slant™ technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2¼D cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever.Next Level Shootouts – Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. The intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and 100s of bullets.Roster of Not Heroes - Select between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime murdering abilities. Blast the city’s scum through doors with Cletus’ a shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy’s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it’s terrible face with Ronald’s hammer.Dynamic Missions – Go ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and victory.","game_category":"Action, Adventure, Arcade, Action","release_date":"2018-08-02","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Devolver Digital","developer":"Roll7","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish","required_space":"649 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/n/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","type":"image"}],"idx":4888},{"name":"Nurse Love Addiction","nameEn":"Nurse Love Addiction","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/nurse-love-addiction-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$39.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000025522","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Features:*Branching story arcs and multiple endings*Unique, vibrant characters.*Bittersweet love and romantic illustrations of girls on their way to adulthood.*Unpredictable plot twists*If ER was a visual novel: life, love and medicine.StoryAsuka Osachi, a ditzy and easy going girl, graduates high school and enrolls in Teito Nursing School with her younger sister, Nao.
