You’ve finally escaped and all of the people you meet are strangers. You c figure out how you got there and you don’t know why you’re there. Not only are you stuck, but strange events occur one after the other — patients are killed, strange figures appear, there are rooms that shouldn’t exist, children are missing..., what happened to this hospital?\n\nDream is a mysterious and dramatic puzzle game where the players play the protagonist that has woken up in an unfamiliar hospital. Throughout the exploration to discover how everything started, there are many unexplainable and weird occurrences. Players need to use their intelligence to solve puzzles and devices and discover the secrets hidden in the hospital.\n\nAs the story progresses, players will explore and solve puzzles in more than 10 scenes. There will be many puzzles and devices in every scene as some require you to search for hidden clues or answers, while others will test the players’ logic and processing capabilities. Players will have to carefully search every corner of the scene and solve various puzzles to move onto the next segment of the story.\n\nPlayers will get to choose from various options from time to time and players will have to consider their current situation to select the most appropriate option. Some choices won’t affect the progress of the game, while others may lead to death and the end of the game. In addition, players will also find many important items when they aren’t solving puzzles, which can provide additional clues towards uncovering the mysteries in the plot.\n\nDream will start with players waking up in the morgue and then they will come into contact with all kinds of people, occurrences and items. In addition, the players will encounter figures and scenes that should not appear in a hospital, making the story even more confusing. If you are a person who loves a mystery and the supernatural, this is a game you can’t miss out on.","game_category":"Adventure, Puzzle","release_date":"2020-10-15","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Winking","developer":"Rising Win Tech","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, Chinese, English","required_space":"1.5 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","type":"image"}],"idx":4750},{"name":"Drunken Fist","nameEn":"Drunken Fist","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/drunken-fist-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$7.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000034244","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Street fights have never been funnier!

To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy, more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'.

The SORD team at Mihama Academy are presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first ever encounter.GameplayIt's a visual novel in which you don't need to make any choices, so you can enjoy the story like you would when watching a movie or reading a book.

Goosebumps-inducing soundtrack!\n\n• The space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole, triggering various dynamic events such as modified enemy stats and positions, boss appearances and horde assaults.\n\n• If you are struggling, get someone to join you in a couch co-op session, or call for assistance online. The loot is shared, and the experience of local player two is saved and not watered down.\n","game_category":"Adventure, Action, Role-Playing","release_date":"2021-02-25","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"tinyBuild Games","developer":null,"no_of_players":"up to 2 players","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, English","required_space":"3.2 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":true,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050712","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/h/hellpoint-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050712","type":"image"}],"idx":4795},{"name":"Her Love in the Force","nameEn":"Her Love in the Force","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/her-love-in-the-force-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$24.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000034591","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"The Story:Join The Public Safety Police Academy and dive into a world of men!

I had to. Something deep in my brain – deep in my very soul – clawed at me, struggling to make sense of everything. But the sad truth is that it never could. I never could. I still can’t remember who I am.”\n\nHello, prospective crew member! Welcome to Shakhter-One, the first space mining ship to gather resources from the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter! Shakhter-One provides mass quantities of supplies to a resource-starved Earth. Thanks to Shakhter-One, we no longer have to depend on coal or oil! Still not sold on making Shakhter-One your new home?\n\n“I don’t even know if this has happened before. Me, here, telling this same, exact story. …Surely not. I would remember that… Right?”\n\nShakhter-One offers a fresh start among the stars! On Shakhter-One, everybody is important! Everybody is employed! All children have an equal start! We’re confident you’ll see that Shakhter-One is the perfect place to begin your family’s future!\n\n“The only thing that I can truly be sure of is the constant, pervading feeling I have deep inside. I’m empty. I’m hollow.”\n\nIn “Hollow,” you are one of the pilots that transports precious resource cargo from the mining ship Shakhter-One down to Earth. One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don’t remember who you are, or how you got out there… All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.\n\nWhen you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship’s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and – ultimately – your life.\n\nThe worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves.\nThe worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.","game_category":"Adventure,
