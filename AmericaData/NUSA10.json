Dig to discover treasure, adventure and bones! Jump, dash, stomp and dig your way through a strange world inhabited by stranger creatures.\n\nSimple, expressive control scheme – Run, dig, drop, jump or dash using only the control stick and one button!\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nPlay both Game Modes:\n\nBone Hunt – The roguelike treasure hunt. Dig for bones across four worlds of increasing difficulty. Battle enemies above perilous cliffs and sunken desert caves. Die a lot.\n\nFree Dig – An endless digging experience. Dig through an infinite set of levels with minor challenge and no game overs. Progress is saved.\n\n• Forge your own path as you creatively tunnel through each level.\n• Travel to new worlds! Uncover stranger and more dangerous environments.\n• Hunt for bones and treasure as you dive deeper.\n• Discover shops and buy items, but don't get too greedy!\n• Keep sniffing out bones to unlock a variety of color themes.\n• A thumpin’ 8-bit soundtrack you’ll surely dig.\n\nA WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nEach time you play Dig Dog, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.\n\nOr maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)\n\nAs you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.\n\nOn a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved that it's now complete.\n\nI hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there’s a lot to uncover here!\n\n-Rusty﻿","game_category":"Platformer, Action, Adventure, Arcade","release_date":"2019-04-26","agerating":"e","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Wild Rooster","developer":"Wild Rooster","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese","required_space":"165 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dig-dog-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","type":"image"}],"idx":458},{"name":"Digerati Indie Bundle: INK & HackyZack","nameEn":"Digerati Indie Bundle: INK & HackyZack","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/digerati-indie-bundle-ink-and-hackyzack-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000013571","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Enjoy two indie favourites from Digerati!

But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls.Divine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.Six of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.Key Features:    Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)    Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents    Special moves    Tile-based isometric 3D graphics    Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound designGame mechanics:The game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.The player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.Each turn, the player has two move options:    The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.    You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.Special moves:    If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.    If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.    If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.There are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.Game modes:There are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.    Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones.
