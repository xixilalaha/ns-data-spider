In Luckslinger, ride the west of bandits, steal their luck, and use it for your own good. The more luck you have, the more chance you have for bullet evasion, better loot at your feet, and staying alive. However, when you're \"\"down on your luck\"\" in your trusty bracelet, bridges collapse, rocks tumble, and outlaws might know where you're sleeping that night.\nIn Luckslinger, we rely on the luck of the draw.\n\nClovercreek and the crazy outlaws – The town of Clovercreek has been robbed blind. Six infamous criminals stole the town’s precious luck charms and it’s up to you to bring them back. Get paid the golden price while doing so, because bounty hunters don’t do charity work.\n\nDuck friend till the end – At all times you are accompanied by your companion Duckbridge. He returns your throwing knife, grabs extra health and distracts your enemies… but only when his tiny little duck brain tells him to do so.\n\nKey Features:\n- Levels with different themes, unique elements and crazy boss characters.\n- A completely unique luck mechanic that keeps the gameplay dynamic.\n- Intense gun and knife throwing gameplay that will keep you on your toes.\n- Music to pleasure your eardrums that fit the hip hoppy atmosphere of the game.\n- A duck companion who’s always by your side.\n- Gambling!\n- One-on-one pistol quick-draw duels.\n- Converse with the nice townsfolk of Clovercreek.\n- Hidden goldbars for the extra challenge.\n- Bonus hip-hop tracks by various artists.","game_category":"Adventure, Action","release_date":"2021-04-09","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"2Awesome Studio","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Chinese","required_space":"224 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050611","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050611","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/luckslinger-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050611","type":"image"}],"idx":3900},{"name":"Mad Bullets","nameEn":"Mad Bullets","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mad-bullets-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000020827","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Mad Bullets, the wackiest shooter will put your reflexes and laughing muscles to an intensive test.

You live in the village of Omen, and your favorite snack is the fingers of small children. As a Monster, you pop up in the most interesting places — what do you do when three angry bears discover a young child in their cabin? Or when you spy a wolf hunting down that woman with the red cloak? As a Monsterling, your choices are simple ones. Do you chase those poor little mice (+1 Ferocity) or protect them from the dogs (+1 Kindness)? Do you come clean about that fungus your friends ate (+1 Honesty) or cover for them (+1 Bravery)? As a youth, your choices determine your personality. But all youngins must grow up. Monsters and Humans have been at odds for centuries, and there are Human villages on the other side of the enchanted woods. When Human children get lost in those dark and winding thickets, do you terrorize them for fun (+1 Ferocity)? Do you help return them to Human civilization to prove that not all Monsters are to be feared and hated (+1 Kindness)? Or do you fatten them up for Human foie gras — a Monster delicacy? All this, to the backdrop of increasing tensions between Monster- and Humankind.Key features: - Balance Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, Kindness, and Respect to wield political power.  - Over 900 choices to make. Chase the Puss in Boots. Gobble up Hansel and Gretel. Eat the Three Little Pigs.  - Encounter different adventures each time you play, with a dozen or so possible endings.  - Bonus: Become a Neurosurgeon without having to attend medical school.
