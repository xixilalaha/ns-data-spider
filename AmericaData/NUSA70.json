Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.Use the EnvironmentAs you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.Learn Skills from your EnemyThroughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.Game Features:- A totally new approach to strategy roguelike gameplay- Synchronous turn-based combat, where each move is full of possibilities and each battle is a challenge- Explore the atmospheric dungeons of different settings and try your best to survive until the end- Experience randomly generated dungeons, weapons, relics, items, and challenges each time you start your journey- Build your own unique combat style and choose from the variety of 40+ active skills, 60+ passive abilities, 30+ usable items, 170+ special relics- Slay 100+ different monsters wielding nine unique types of weapons or up to 120+ individual weapons in total- Dare to challenge more than 10+ powerful bosses- Solve 60+ mysterious challenges and puzzles- Reveal all the secrets and find the truth hidden behind the Nightmare Realm","game_category":"Adventure, Strategy, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-10-16","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Team17","developer":"NEXT Studios","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, English","required_space":"1.2 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/crown-trick-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":3450},{"name":"Cruel Bands Career","nameEn":"Cruel Bands Career","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/cruel-bands-career-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$3.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000022102","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"They are on a secret mission and must face varied audiences and bosses to complete their quest.Cruel Bands Career features highly varied gameplay and a unique art style.The three-man band is on a secret mission, the only thorn in their side being the constant stream of audience.

Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.\n OTHER SPECIESThe ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races.

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game.\n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run.\n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts?
