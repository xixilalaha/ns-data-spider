Being a good RGB agent requires a lot of talent. Spy Chameleon is an arcade-puzzle game where the player must avoid being seen thanks to the chameleon's ability to change colors and camouflage.

Watch your enemies, choose the best path and run to the next safe point. The duration of each level can mean finishing a game in just minutes or spending hours trying to complete the missions and all the challenges, getting the best time among your friends or completing all the achievements. Game features: • change colors to camouflage yourself with your surroundings • 75 levels where the difficulty increases as you learn new mechanics • 3 challenges in each level: gather collectables and beat a time • playability that combines reflexes, synchronization and strategy (at 60 FPS in 1080p) • compare your best times with those of your friends or the whole world","game_category":"Arcade, Puzzle, Adventure, Other","release_date":"2018-03-09","agerating":"e","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Unfinished Pixel","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, German, Italian, Spanish, English","required_space":"479 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/spy-chameleon-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":1307},{"name":"Spot The Differences: Party!","nameEn":"Spot The Differences: Party!","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/spot-the-differences-party-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$4.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000016389","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"The most complete difference game on Nintendo Switch!

Start from ZERO and become the smallest creature – a spark of life - which has endless development paths ahead of it. Your task is to find food, which helps to grow and develop.
