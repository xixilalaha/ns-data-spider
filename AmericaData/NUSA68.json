For example, the player can lie, support their testimony with additional evidence or even pretend to be insane in order to clear the protagonist of charges. The way of achieving the goal here depends exclusively on the player's imagination and tactics they apply. Thus, each playthrough can be completely different.

Wield magic cards and slay the armies of darkness in the Old Cathedral dungeons. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself!Cards and Deckbuilding - Book of Demons is not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most awesome, but hard to acquire.Tailored sessions with Flexiscope - Book of Demons respects your time. Features the Flexiscope engine, which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns the pace of your gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.Unique Mechanics - Simplified movement and combat mechanics are what sets Book of Demons apart from most other hack & slash games. There's often just not enough time to click-remove all obstacles, such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.Hack & Slash in the world of the Paperverse - Book of Demons takes place in the Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside of a pop-up book.It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute and part parody of the hack & slash classics.Comfort of Gameplay - Many Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.Challenging Endgame - On average, it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing, and even more obstacles to overcome.","game_category":"Adventure, Action, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-04-30","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"505 Games","developer":"SONKA","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, English","required_space":"801 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/book-of-demons-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","type":"image"}],"idx":3357},{"name":"Boom Blaster","nameEn":"Boom Blaster","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/boom-blaster-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$4.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000037422","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Boom Blaster is an outstanding, brain-blasting, groundshaking, oldschool mega Run ‘n Gun game!A group of space prisoners took their chance to escape.

The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer’s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic.\n\nThe brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler’s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments – full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest. But remember – the body of stone has its limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms and the ability to wield additional weapons with it.\n\nCastle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The game’s aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the Slavic mythology – with some locations derived straight from famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers’ home country – and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach, utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch™ features, which will enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.","game_category":"Platformer, Action, Adventure","release_date":"2018-03-23","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"7Levels","developer":"7Levels","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese","required_space":"3.1 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/castle-of-heart-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":3390},{"name":"CastleStorm","nameEn":"CastleStorm","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/castlestorm-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000009660","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Enjoy a unique take on medieval warfare in Zen Studios’ light-hearted action-strategy game – enhanced with new features designed specifically for Nintendo Switch™!

Each game is unique with procedurally generated levels to explore and a massive amount of items, weapons and equipment to discover.\n\nAs you delve deeper in to the cave, you'll discover new areas to explore, new weapons and new monsters to try them out on.\n\nSmart Characters!\nThroughout your journey you will encounter AI characters. Some friendly, some hostile. We're using an advanced pathfinding system which means friendly characters will be able to follow you wherever you go, and hostile characters will be able to track you down wherever you hide. There is no escape. Be afraid!\n\nPlatformer Roguelike!\nCaveblazers is a modern platformer which incorporates some Roguelike and RPG elements such as permanent death, randomized potion identities, an RPG-style inventory system and tons of items, equipment and upgrades!\n\nDaily Challenge Runs!\nEach day a new adventure will be generated! It will be the same for everyone and you'll only get one chance at it! These challenge runs give you a starting loadout, and feature a set of different traits.\n\nEpic Boss Battles!\nBetween each area you'll encounter a boss. Each boss is very unique, requiring a different strategy to defeat. Bosses are generally gigantic monstrosities with life bars stretching across the entire screen. Good luck!\n\nCharacter Customization!\nA whole load of unlockable hats, tunics, trousers, robes, and more! Or perhaps you fancy stripping off and heading in to the caves in the nude? Go for it!\n\nCompelling Combat!\nLargely overlooked in other modern Roguelike games, Caveblazers attempts to move away from the simplistic combat systems we've seen in other games in the genre, and incorporates fun, fluid and fast-paced combat which is accentuated by the game's brutal and persistent blood effects.\n\nChallenges!\nIn case that isn't enough content, Caveblazers features a bunch of challenges for the well seasoned players to take a punt at.
