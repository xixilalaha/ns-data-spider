Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming.

Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!Don't worry though, you won't be alone!

Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","game_category":"Adventure, Puzzle, Fighting, Role-Playing","release_date":"2021-01-22","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"QubicGames","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English","required_space":"144 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050710","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050710","type":"image"}],"idx":2994},{"name":"Timber Tennis: Versus","nameEn":"Timber Tennis: Versus","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/timber-tennis-versus-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$1.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000001907","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Meet Timber Tennis: Versus, an entirely new addition to the Timberman family - a series of games enjoyed by more than 30 000 000 people around the world!Take part in the annual Timber Tennis world championships - use your special skills, watch out for super shots, and collect prizes to beat all the rivals and reach the grand final!

But for what? To test their cooperation skills of course! So they tied them together to a tiny monstrous chain and let them make their way through colourfull, tricky, cooperative experimental set-ups that only scientists can think up.Anybody complained the plot is as flat as 2D? Bullseye! You are right. The unbelievable truth is: YOU are the monsters and WE are the scientists. Get tied to your friends and we will test your cooperation skills and creativity! And we will even test your friendship…Single players don’t even have a chance to handle the monster’s challenges. Also, it's a lot more fun to play with friends instead of playing alone, right?!? As a team you have to coordinate movement, jumps and cling to ground and walls to complete the levels and stay alive. That’s not as easy as it sounds, but all the funnier! And every time your monstrous cooperative skills are not enough it will end up in great chaos – and great laughter.Come on, subject, what about your friendship and cooperative skills?Fun-tied features:- Play our award-winning highly funny local co-op 2D party game!- Tons of cooperative and non-violent fun for the whole family - from child to granny!- Over 40 challenging levels in the Duo Mode (2 players)- And more than 20 tricky levels in the Party Mode (3 or 4 players)- Finish the levels as fast as possible and earn Gold, Silver or Bronze based on your time!- Let the tied-together co-op fun begin!","game_category":"Platformer, Puzzle, Party, Multiplayer","release_date":"2018-10-19","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Headup Games","developer":"Napalmtree studios","no_of_players":"up to 4 players","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, English","required_space":"685 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":false,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tied-together-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":2997},{"name":"Thunderflash","nameEn":"Thunderflash","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/thunderflash-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$4.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000034533","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Inspired by nostalgic retro games you know and love, Thunderflash will drop you into the combat zone top-down, and the intensity will never let up.
