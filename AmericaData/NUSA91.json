Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread.Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded.Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters.The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..?Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain.Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners.Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail.Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly.Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking!Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners.A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life.This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them.Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison...Truth be told, no one has attempted this before.","game_category":"Role-Playing, Action, Adventure, Strategy","release_date":"2020-03-26","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Black Tower Games","developer":"goonswarm","no_of_players":"","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Russian, Chinese","required_space":"1.2 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sin-slayers-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4502},{"name":"Silence","nameEn":"Silence","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/silence-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$39.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000010629","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"War rages on.

The dark power that fueled that war has vanished, but darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary hero, Orazio, is no more. 10 years ago he left without explanation and never returned, leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark secret he left behind—a secret that must now be revealed if the children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though its revelation could unhinge the world. Shadows of Adam is a creative, humorous and exciting take on the 16-bit JRPG era, but with its own twists and style for the modern day gamer. Fast-paced battles, gorgeous graphics, an awesome soundtrack and the convenience to save anywhere you like make it tough to resist! Whether playing on the TV or in handheld mode, the game’s glorious pixels will immerse you in the adventure and its memorable scenes.Features:•\tCompelling Character Driven Story: Shadows of Adam’s story is one with a deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.•\tA Strategic AP Management Battle System: AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.•\tBeautiful Visuals: Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the '90s.•\tOriginal Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks: An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that’s inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melodies and an emotional connection.","game_category":"Adventure, Role-Playing","release_date":"2019-05-03","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"CIRCLE Entertainment","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Chinese, English","required_space":"1.2 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4521},{"name":"Shadowgate","nameEn":"Shadowgate","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/shadowgate-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$19.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000015028","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Shadowgate is one of the most well-known and beloved adventure titles in gaming history.

And they’re about to save the world.\n\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.\n\nNow everyone’s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.\n\nIt’s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the “spinny thing” they do with their eyes.)\n\nWho’s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam’s nose for detective work, Max’s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max’s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.\n\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called “gaming’s first sitcom” and is today known as “the remaster you didn’t know you were waiting for.” With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con™ and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN’s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch™ library.\n","game_category":"Adventure, Puzzle","release_date":"2020-12-02","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Skunkape Games","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, English","required_space":"848 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/sam-and-max-save-the-world-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","type":"image"}],"idx":4549}]
