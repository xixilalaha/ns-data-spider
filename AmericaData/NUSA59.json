Players with a tactical approach will also be able to build a base – by constructing additional hangars and supporting structures and then ensuring their safety by building anti-aircraft artillery and barrage balloons.There’s all this, plus over 30 historical airplanes at their disposal: from classic fighters to light and heavy bombers which they can fly, repaint, customize, and upgrade. Included in the collection are the Spitfire, Hurricane, Lancaster, II-2 “Shturmovik”, La-5FN, Ju-87 “Stuka”, Fw 200 “Condor”, and a Nintendo Switch™ exclusive – the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. Warplanes: WW2 Dogfight offers easy-to-learn gameplay with intuitive controls and user-friendly flight mechanics. The game features precise graphic design, with detailed 3D models and amazing special effects, making the entire air combat experience more immersive.
