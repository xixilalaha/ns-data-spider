Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! TAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEMOver 80 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment. Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!FOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHEREat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.HARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMSHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.SUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMSBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.RPG STATISTICSLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.HARDCORE MECHANICSItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft.

It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them.\n\nSouls with a Twist\nAshen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it.\n\nCreatures + Combat\nAshen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.\n\nCrafting is Key\nAs you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.\n\nStory + Score\nFamed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (The Broken Empire trilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at Aurora44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and

Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy game. Explore Forman’s life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences (and unpredictable side effects!) 13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients’ problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients’ satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge. So-called “real” (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman prove these medical establishment elitists wrong! Features- Perform real* astrology: Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an exact science!)- Solve Hilarious Problems: Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies!- Change Lives: Win your patients’ favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and manipulate others.- Win A Medical Licence: Convince patients to write letters of recommendations. Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence.- Fully Voiced Character Dialogue: Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast of over a dozen actors.- Sing Along: Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character’s theme song.- Casebooks Come Alive: Simon Forman’s cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients’ stories. The StoryLondon, 1592. A great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, “Doctor” of Astrology, Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can find their lost pets and predict their futures! All by reading the movements of the stars. But when the plague ends, Forman’s problems begin. The real doctors return to London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down... SummaryAstrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare’s London. Based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story. Simon Forman was considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. What will your legacy be? Will you put your faith in the stars? ","game_category":"Adventure, Other","release_date":"2021-02-18","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Plug In Digital","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English","required_space":"681 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/astrologaster-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":3269},{"name":"Astrology and Horoscopes Premium","nameEn":"Astrology and Horoscopes Premium","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/astrology-and-horoscopes-premium-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$8.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000016495","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"2021 Astrology and Horoscopes Premium is the most luxury astrology, horoscope and numerology application.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.\n\n《Main Features》\n■ Exploring with new field actions!\nRyza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.\n■ More action-filled real-time battles!\nTake on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.\n■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!\nUtilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with “Evolution Link” to create entirely new items.","game_category":"Role-Playing","release_date":"2021-01-26","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"KOEI TECMO AMERICA","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, English","required_space":"6.8 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/a/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-and-the-secret-fairy-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050702","type":"image"}],"idx":3282},{"name":"Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout","nameEn":"Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/atelier-ryza-ever-darkness-and-the-secret-hideout-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$59.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000021548","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"The concept of this title, the latest in the series to depict a new \"Atelier\" world, is \"True-to-life youths that develop together, even if just a little bit\".\nIt is the story of a girl and her friends who are about to become adults, discovering what is most important to them.\nTo depict the story of the main characters discovering things they've never seen before, we've created fields with natural shadows that allow you to feel the breath of the world.
