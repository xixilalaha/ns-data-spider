Planetarian is a sci-fi visual novel, brought to life with beautiful art and a stirring soundtrack.Planetarian was produced by Japanese studio Key, the creators of CLANNAD and Little Busters!

An exhausted man headed inside a building seeking refuge. Long ago, many would have entered this planetarium, to gaze longingly into the stars, to soothe their sorrows, and to find a sense of peace. In this place of healing, he met a lone girl; a run-down robotic guide who had waited thirty long years for a visitor to come. Her name was Yumemi. Her one wish was for someone to repair the broken projector.Endless rain...The man's fleeting days with Yumemi reminded him of days long gone. As he worked tirelessly to fix that which was broken he wondered, what would he wish for when he finally gazed into those artificial stars? What fate lied before Yumemi?","game_category":"Adventure, Other","release_date":"2019-01-31","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"PROTOTYPE","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, Chinese, English","required_space":"683 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050617","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050617","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050617","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050617","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050617","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050617","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/p/planetarian-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050617","type":"image"}],"idx":4087},{"name":"Please Teach Me Onedari Shogi","nameEn":"Please Teach Me Onedari Shogi","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/please-teach-me-onedari-shogi-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$7.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000021892","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"The Onedari Girls are Shogi novices.When they face a difficult situation, they request a “Do-Over” or “Hint.”Accept their requests to get along with the girls!When you get to know them better, you will receive a special treat...Equipped with a function that helps you feel like you can teach the girls Shogi even if you are a beginner!Shogi game for adults.■ Onedari GirlsYour girlfriend in 2.5 dimensions!Satou Airi- Birthday: March 4- Height: 149 cm (4’10”)- Measurements: B88, W59, H85 (cm) (B: 35, W: 23, H: 33 (in))- Likes: Games, animation, theater, baking sweets- Dislikes: Vegetables- CommentsI started to cosplay!Please get to know me much better!!Please take care of me!Mighty rabbitUno Yui- Birthday: January 5- Height: 165 cm (5’5”)- Measurements: B80, W58, H88 (cm) (B: 31, W:23, H: 35 (in))- Likes: Rabbits, strawberries, the color pink, idols, chocolates, sushi- Dislikes: Bugs, asparagus, coriander leaves, celery, hot days- Comments:I’m Yui Uno.
