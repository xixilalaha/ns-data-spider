With over 100 items at your disposal, you will find the tools you need to find the teleporter back home. Discover a myriad of randomly chosen stages, from the desolate forest to the frozen tundra. The three main goals for our game are simple: 1. Design a game that is randomly generated every play-through, to keep replayability high and fresh. 2. Time = difficulty. The higher the in-game time gets, the harder the difficulty gets. Keeping a sense of urgency keeps the game exciting! 3. Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose. No more fussing with complex and non-intuitive gameplay patterns.
