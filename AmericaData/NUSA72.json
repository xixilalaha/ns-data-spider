A battle accountant there, George, is assigned the unenviable task of leaving the safety of the city in order to storm a nearby castle, slay the dragon, rescue the princess, and (most importantly) rescue the unpaid tax revenue. Meanwhile, Ayraw (the dragon), is tired of knights showing up to slay her, and is a bit jealous no one ever wants to rescue her. So she concocts a plan to trick George into rescuing her instead of rescuing the princess. Hijinks ensue as the two team up, the unlikely duo slowly growing closer through their shared adventure.","game_category":"Adventure, Other, Puzzle","release_date":"2021-04-15","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Archive Entertainment","developer":"Archive Entertainment","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, English","required_space":"7.9 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050701","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050701","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dragon-audit-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050701","type":"image"}],"idx":3550},{"name":"DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ","nameEn":"DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dragon-ball-fighterz-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$59.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000006225","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"DRAGON BALL FighterZ is born from what makes the DRAGON BALL series so loved and famous: endless spectacular fights with its all-powerful fighters.\n\nPartnering with Arc System Works, DRAGON BALL FighterZ maximizes high end Anime graphics and brings easy to learn but difficult to master fighting gameplay.\n\nHigh-end Anime Graphics\nUsing the power of the Unreal engine and the talented team at Arc System Works, DRAGON BALL FighterZ is a visual tour-de-force.\n\n3vs3 Tag/Support\nBuild your dream team and sharpen your skills to master high-speed tag combinations.\n\nThrilling Online Features\nRanked matches, interactive lobby, crazy 6-player Party Match...

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero’s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero’s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there’s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! By using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.","game_category":"Platformer, Action, Arcade, Adventure","release_date":"2018-06-28","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"No Gravity Games","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish","required_space":"4.7 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dream-alone-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":3561},{"name":"Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator","nameEn":"Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000020858","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"This game includes Dream Daddy: Dadrector’s Cut.

While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.\n\nIn fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.\n\nLuckily, every set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of Endless facility, all the way down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon…\n\nGather A Team\n• Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)\n• Equip them, deploy them, and earn powerful abilities\n• Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guards\n\nBuild Your Defenses\n• Use the Dust you gather to power the rooms\n• Use scarce resources to help your team survive\n• Build minor and major modules to hold off waves of monsters\n• Decode Endless ruins to discover life-saving technologies\n\nOpen the Door\n• Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anything\n• Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layouts\n• Carry your crystal through waves of monsters to the exit of each level\n• Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about Auriga\n\nThe game also includes the following content:\n•Deep Freeze\n•Death Gamble\n•Rescue Team\n•Organic Matters","game_category":"Action, Strategy","release_date":"2020-05-15","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"PLAYDIGIOUS","developer":"Amplitude Studios","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, English","required_space":"2.0 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/d/dungeon-of-the-endless-switch/screenshot-gallery/dungeon-of-the-endless-screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":3567},{"name":"Dungeon Warfare","nameEn":"Dungeon Warfare","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dungeon-warfare-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000021203","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Dungeon Warfare is a challenging tower defense game where you become a dungeon lord to defend your dungeon against greedy adventurers.As you successfully purify your dungeons throughout the world from the pesky invaders, you will gain access to more powerful traps and devious utilities.

Visually inspired by classic 16 and 8 bit games, Elden: Path of the Forgotten is a stunning, encapsulating, dark world waiting to be explored.FEATURES* Many diverse and challenging regions.* Horrifying Lovecraftian enemies and bosses.* Unique and brutal weapons and spells.* Powerful and dynamic items.","game_category":"Adventure, Action, Role-Playing","release_date":"2020-07-09","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Another Indie Studio","developer":"Onerat Games","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese","required_space":"784 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/e/elden-path-of-the-forgotten-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":3581},{"name":"Eldest Souls","nameEn":"Eldest Souls","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/eldest-souls-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000028401","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"In the beginning, there were Gods.

The heavens opened up and stars fell like beacons into the pitch black world, and they were known as “Embers”. Powerful and wise druids of a primordial race, “the Lightbringers,\" roamed the land searching for this luminous matter. They performed a ritual of awakening to call the “Embers” out of their deep sleep. Suddenly the world became bright, and the veil of darkness was lifted. The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured…and so the War for Ember began…Gameplay overviewA passion project 10 years in the making, Ember is a homage to classic role-playing games (RPG).

Pick three Reapers, the aspects of death, and fight your opponent in real-time, cooldown-based combat. You'll control all three characters at once, sequencing their abilities and setting up explosive combos to decimate your opponent. But be careful - every time a Reaper dies, they come back stronger, so moving closer to victory will make your opponents even more deadly.Fast-Paced Tactical Combat:Epitaph’s combat is a unique mix of strategy and timing - think Darkest Dungeon’s abilities mixed with Final Fantasy’s Active Time Battle System. You’ll have to outwit and outsmart your opponent in real time, planning and sequencing your abilities carefully to land devastating combos and counter your opponent’s intentions.Battle Among Deaths:Epitaph takes place in the afterlife, where the many faces of Death are fighting against one another in a battle for souls. There are 13 different Reapers in Epitaph's roster, and you’ll draft a team of three to fit your personal strategy. Will you take Becilla, the Commander, who charges into battle and calls her allies to her side, or Ezzim the Executioner, who relentlessly hunts down his victims with his mighty ax?
