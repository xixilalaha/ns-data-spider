As you stumble deeper though the station evading your human caretakers, you steal things like widgets and socks. And you stash them, because you’re a ferret.Every widget you collect adds to the weight of your satchel, making it a little harder to reach the next platform or avoid the station’s maintenance bots. Stash enough widgets, and you can use them to fabricate doohickeys, which help you unlock new paths and previously out of reach areas. It’s a ferretroidvania!But don't worry: You may lose some widgets (or your socks!), but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no \"game over.\" And nothing is blocking your path to the shuttlebay, so the game is only as challenging as you want it to be.It's up to you: race though the station at top speed, or meander around knocking over piles of junk and hitting bots with your wrench. Or… gather up all your ferret-y determination to stash away each widget, discover every trinket, and try on all 30+ pairs of socks -- including a Nintendo Switch™ exclusive pair of “Joy-Sock” that match your Joy-Con™ colors!Even after you finish the game, the adventure isn't over. Escape your playpen again (and again) to pursue different challenges.
