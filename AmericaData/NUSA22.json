Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which goals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There also exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain conditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that appears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a total of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.The game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany you as you play
