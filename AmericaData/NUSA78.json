In the past decade, we have seen spin-off games and console adaptations, as well as the release of comic, novel, and anime adaptations.\nIt's easy to see why; the underlying theme of friendship in this romantic adventure game has had players hooked from the very start.\nNow, get ready to laugh and cry your way through the \"Little Busters!\" story as the game comes to Nintendo Switch!\n\nPlay in English or the original Japanese!\nBoth English and Japanese text is available in-game (audio is Japanese-only). This option is not only available in the main game, but in the settings menu, and digital manual too, with the option to switch between the two whenever you like.\nDon't worry if you come across a cultural reference you don't understand; you can check out their explanations in the \"Busterpedia!\"\n\nPlay using only the touch screen! Play with one hand!\nPlay in handheld mode with the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con™ controllers attached, or detach them and play with just the touch controls!\nWhile in tabletop mode or TV mode, everything can be controlled using one Joy-Con(R), allowing you to play with only one hand!\n\"Little Busters!\" is also compatible with the Nintendo Switch Lite.\n\n\nSummary\nWhen he lost his parents as a child, protagonist Riki Naoe was plunged into despair.\nHowever, someone was there to lend him a helping hand—Kyousuke Natsume, the leader of a group of youths who called themselves the \"Little Busters.\"\nThrough many happy hours spent with the Little Busters, slowly but surely, Riki's pain and loneliness began to fade.\n\nNow, we fast-forward a few years to the present—\n\nWhile Riki and the other Little Busters have remained friends through the years, they now face brand new obstacles—job hunting, university applications, and thinking about their future!\nPainfully aware that he only has a little more time left with his friends, Riki suggests they do all the things they won't be able to do in future.\nOne day, having seemingly taken this to heart, Kyousuke blurts out a sudden declaration.\n\n\"We're forming a baseball team. The team name will be... Little Busters!\"\n\n\nGameplay\n\"Little Busters!\" has multiple endings. The choices you make during the story will have an effect on which ending you get.\nIn addition, the gameplay includes plenty of minigames for you to enjoy! Try your skills at Batting Practice and Matches with the Little Busters members, or serve up food in the Cafeteria! Too tame for your tastes? Then try out the Underground Dungeon or the Shooting Game instead!\nWhile winning/losing minigames does affect the following gameplay, it does not have much of an influence on the storyline. If minigames aren't your style, you can turn them on and off in the game's settings, allowing you to play through the story without them.\n\n\nStaff\nOriginal Artwork: Itaru Hinoue / Na-Ga\nScenario: Jun Maeda / Yuto Tonokawa / Chika Shirokiri / Leo Kashida\nMusic: Shinji Orito / Magome Togoshi / Jun Maeda / Manack / PMMK\n\n\nCast\nKomari Kamikita VA: Natsumi Yanase\nRin Natsume VA: Tomoe Tamiyasu\nHaruka Saigua VA: Keiko Suzuki\nKudryavka Noumi VA: Naomi Wakabayashi\nYuiko Kurugaya VA: Ryoko Tanaka\nMio Nishizono VA: Shiho Kawaragi\nKanata Futaki VA: Keiko Suzuki\nSasami Sasasegawa VA: Tomoe Tamiyasu\nSaya Tokido VA: Harumi Sakurai\nKyousuke Natsume VA: Hikaru Midorikawa\nMasato Inohara VA: Nobutoshi Canna\nKengo Miyazawa VA: Yusei Oda\nFull voice acting (main character only partly voiced)","game_category":"Adventure","release_date":"2020-04-23","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"PROTOTYPE","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English","required_space":"4.1 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/little-busters-converted-edition-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","type":"image"}],"idx":3885},{"name":"Little Inferno","nameEn":"Little Inferno","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/little-inferno-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000000160","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"*** OVER 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD! ***Now multiplayer!

Shiraishi travel to the locally famous haunted resort, the Hotel Izanami, at Nana's request to shoot a video there.\nIt would be a film shoot at an average haunted location with no particular legend attached.\nTo finish shooting without a hitch and get an end result that was vaguely horror-esque...was all they wanted.\n\nDuring filming, Mio gets separated from the group, and suddenly gets attacked by a mascot costume that has come to life.\nFrom that point on, the trapped girls are at the mercy of numerous horrors throughout the hotel.\nWhy is a mascot trying to harm them, and why have they been shut in to the hotel with no escape?\nCan the three girls escape from the hotel with their lives?\n\nA livestream set in an abandoned hotel begins...\n\n\n■Run from the mysterious mascot chasing you, and escape from the abandoned hotel!\n\nWhile exploring the inside of an abandoned hotel, a mascot swinging a bloody hatchet suddenly appears and starts chasing after the three streamers!\nWhen you encounter the mascot, run away quickly, hide yourself, and escape from its pursuit. One hit from the mascot's hatchet will lead to instant death (game over).\n\n■Use hints and items to help you find clues on how to escape!\n\nWhile exploring the hotel ruins, you will come across various items and hints.\nSearch every nook and cranny of the rooms to get items and hints that will help you survive!\nSome items will greatly change the fates of the girls...\n\n■Is this a curse?! The livestreaming girls are cornered by the descent of a life-threatening horror!\n\nYou'll be met with various frights while exploring the hotel ruins. Investigate your surroundings to get hints and use items you find to help the girls escape from desperate situations.\nYou can even touch the girls, regardless of their plight...
