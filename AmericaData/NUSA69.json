Desperate to find an escape, they seek refuge in the city’s seamy slums and brave the sunless pits of the underworld. Out to get them are heavily armed city guards, rival gangs and psychotic families of subterranean cannibals. Abandoned by the system and used by selfish criminals, these young companions will be forced to come to terms with their own reality. But be warned - in the world of Children of Zodiarcs, no one escapes unscathed!\n\nFeatures\nCombat Cards\nEach of your party members’ attacks & abilities are bound to combat cards. Drawing different cards during battle provides you with ever changing combat possibilities every time you fight!\n\nEmpower Cards through Dice\nOnce you’ve chosen your attack, physics based dice allow you to roll for bonuses! Favoring symbols over numbers, these dice deliver attack, defence, healing, and special ability modifiers.\n\nInfluencing Lady Luck\nTo add yet more layers of stratagem to Children of Zodiarcs, you can craft dice to favour your play style, and re-roll up to two dice every time you throw. You need not fear being at Lady Luck’s mercy!\n\nA World Full of Characters\nAlong the way you’ll come to learn about Nahmi - stolen from her homeland as a child, Brice - forced to survive on the mean streets of Torus; Zirchhoff - a charismatic bandit leader who employs young orphans to do his bidding: as well as many more mischief makers.\n\nBuilding Decks\nEach playable character comes with their own customisable deck. This allows you to tailor their skillset to the types of attacks and abilities you want to have in your hand during the heat of combat.\n\nA Fully Orchestrated Score\nChildren of Zodiarcs’ music captures the feel of tactical RPG classics with its fully orchestrated soundtrack composed by the award winning team at Vibe Avenue.\n\nJoin Nahmi and her team in a harrowing tale of the downtrodden’s struggle for survival in a world where mystical forces are overlooked; and the people in power are solely concerned with profit.

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story.\n\nYou, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost.\n\n\nKey features:\nA deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs.\nOminous but wonderful graphics created with Unreal Engine 4.\nMultiple endings.\nA haunting and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nPowered by Unreal Engine 4, Conarium aims to bring cutting-edge visuals for a more immersive storytelling and gaming experience.","game_category":"Adventure","release_date":"2021-02-04","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Iceberg Interactive","developer":"Iceberg Interactive","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese","required_space":"4.0 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/conarium-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","type":"image"}],"idx":3434},{"name":"Constructor Plus","nameEn":"Constructor Plus","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/constructor-plus-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$19.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000002264","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"In this town you've gotta think BIG!

However, since 2000, various non-governmental terrorist groups have been formed. In 2030, the ISS, the largest terrorist organization united all terrorist groups around the world and started to dominate cities. The ISS has become the most threatening terrorist organization in the world. At that time, new energy source was discovered that could change the future of humankind. The United Nations and NASA have sent a research team to investigate the new energy source. The ISS knew the value of the new energy source, terrorized major cities and occupied the energy source. From that time on, unexplained incidents such as network shutdowns, infectious diseases, mysterious deaths and mysterious aircraft crashes began to occur all over the world. The United Nations has concluded that these incidents are related to newly discovered energy source. The United Nations has formed Counter Recon Special Force with competent veterans to stop terrorism. The mission of the Counter Recon Special Force is to rescue researchers detained in each city and retrieve the energy source occupied by the ISS.","game_category":"First-Person, Action, Arcade","release_date":"2021-03-04","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"TROOOZE","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese","required_space":"2.5 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/c/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch/screenshot-gallery/counter-recon-the-first-mission-switch-screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":3440},{"name":"Crashlands","nameEn":"Crashlands","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/crashlands-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000013050","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Play as Flux Dabes, a galactic delivery truck driver whose latest shipment gets interrupted by a megalomaniacal alien named \"Hewgodooko\" who tears her ship to pieces looking for useful tech.
