It's like a human's essence that can’t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it’s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","game_category":"Puzzle, Action","release_date":"2021-02-05","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"ChiliDog Interactive","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"German, Russian, English","required_space":"146 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050702","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050702","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050702","type":"image"}],"idx":3689},{"name":"Gnosia","nameEn":"Gnosia","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/gnosia-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$24.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000036344","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"The crew of a drifting spaceship, facing off against a mysterious and deadly threat known as the “Gnosia” and having no idea who among them is really the enemy, formulate a desperate plan for survival.

It’s your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.\n\n[Not All Heroes Get Paychecks]\nBattle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!\n\n[Fight Flexibly]\nIn the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment’s notice if you aren’t careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.\n\n[Horrible Bosses]\nAnd you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for.\n\n[Get Paid in Experience]\nAs you explore, you’ll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they’ll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you’ll get it “endorsed” and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you’ll be cleaning house in no time.\n\n[A World of Characters]\nComplete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city.

Monsters, bosses and stage gimmicks can require a specific type of weapon at times creating opportunities for users to strategize their best route of approach.-Customizable Tattoo systemUtilizing \"tattoos\", users are given specific points upon leveling to get the protagonist inked as a form of powering up so it could be built to one’s own.
