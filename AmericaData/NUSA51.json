He is none other than the great David Sant... Sorry, we cannot reveal his identity for now.

Do whatever it takes to get our hero to bring peace and we can be one step closer to the second Golden Age for the industry in the Spanish region!But don't worry, Leopoldo Manquiseil won't be alone in his adventure: he'll count on the support and help of big industry characters like \"Gonzo\" Suarez, Luis Quintans, Sara Borondo, Bruno Sol, Ramón Nafria or Santi Valero, from Video games for food.●\t●\t●“Leopoldo Manquiseil: A new super hero is coming” is a small tribute to one of the biggest names in the Spanish videogame industry: David Santos.Vanir Project, creators of Nightmare Boy, are behind the development of the title, a classic 2D platformer, with a remarkable retro aesthetics and a chiptune soundtrack created by Vic Hernand.Leopoldo Manquiseil is a game with a charity side: 75% of the income obtained will go to David Santos.Leopoldo Manquiseil is an action platformer split into 24 levels with a lot of gameplay mechanics:•\tJump, double jump, dash, climb walls, shoot...•\tSpecial levels in Flappy Bird and Pang style.•\tTwo challenge levels: one simpler is just to reach the end of the level. Another harder way to play will force you to do the above and ALSO get three unique items that will be spread among each level.•\tThe 24 levels are structured in three groups of 8. The last level of each group is always a final boss.","game_category":"Arcade, Platformer","release_date":"2018-12-20","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"BLG Publishing","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, Spanish","required_space":"211 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050708","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/l/leopoldo-manquiseil-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050708","type":"image"}],"idx":2506},{"name":"Liege Dragon","nameEn":"Liege Dragon","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/liege-dragon-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$14.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000032984","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"With Abigore, the Evil Dragon, coming back to life, the kingdom of Blaze was thrown into confusion.
