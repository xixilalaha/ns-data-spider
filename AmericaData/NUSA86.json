Too few are standing up against the monstrosity of the German Reich. Will you? Lead an underground resistance group Through the Darkest of Times. In this strategy game, based on historical events, you plan the actions of your fighters. But what can you do? Fight? A whole army, a whole nation against your group of five. So you have to act carefully and win the hearts and minds of the people, gather more followers, gain more support. And most important: stay alive. You are always in grave danger, if the Gestapo (Germany’s Secret Service Police during the Third Reich) finds out what you are doing, you might end up in prison or worse. Plan. Act. Survive. Through the Darkest of Times is a turn-based gaming-experience. You assign your comrades on important tasks: Produce leaflets or write messages on walls to inform the people what the Nazis are up to. Gather intel about Nazi-Operations and make them public. Sabotage. The bolder you are, the higher the risk – but you want to change something, right? Divided into 4 Chapters, Through the Darkest of Times follows the actual events of the Third Reich era, but your actions have a meaningful impact on your life, the life of your group’s members and many people around you.   Your members are procedurally generated on each playthrough. They come with different personalities, abilities and views. That makes them more suitable for certain tasks but at the same time more vulnerable. Experience history. Through the Darkest of Times creates a sombre mood. You’ll find out more and more about the cruelty, happening around your group. People disapear without a trace, taken by the official police, sometimes found dead shortly after. There are no good or bad decisions, often you’ll have to choose the lesser of two evils and take the consequences. You will always feel the pressure. Have you been watched during your last operation? Can you really trust that new member of your group? Did you do enough to help that family the other day? Dark times need people with the heads held high, no matter what comes. Features: • World War II from a new angle: Resist without fighting• Unique art style, inspired by Weimar Art • Everyday heroes: Your team is made from plumbers, doctors, priests, secretaries or salesmen, not trained fighters• Showing history as it was: As one of the first games ever (in Germany), Through the Darkest of Times received the permission to openly show the Swastika and other symbols of the Nazis to call the enemy by it’s name. • Alternative timeline mode: Could the reign of the Nazis have been ended before 1945?","game_category":"Adventure, Simulation, Strategy","release_date":"2020-08-13","agerating":"t","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"HandyGames","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, English","required_space":"774 MB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/through-the-darkest-of-times-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4276},{"name":"Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales","nameEn":"Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$19.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000026350","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"Thronebreaker is a single player role-playing game set in the world of The Witcher that combines narrative-driven exploration with unique puzzles and card battle mechanics.Crafted by the developers responsible for some of the most iconic moments in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the game spins a truly regal tale of Meve, a war-veteran and queen of two Northern Realms — Lyria and Rivia.

SET! PARENT!Little Bobby’s dead, the BBQ is on fire, Jen’s eating poisonous berries and the birthday cake still needs icing. It’s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a frantic parenting simulator for up to four players. Hauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. Run solo, or team up with other parents to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. KEY FEATURESMulti-tasking mayhem:There’s never a dull moment when you’ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road.Parenting is hard:To get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you’ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and–ideally–alive!Nowhere is safe:The local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, towering grocery shelves and electrified pens.All kinds of families welcome:Single parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It’s all good.

Play as a detective and investigate the murder by shapeshifting into any character. Even the next victim.  Dorota Shaw is dead. And the prime suspects are three tarot readers with the uncanny ability to predict murder - or commit it. It’s your job to find out what else they know - but they won’t reveal their dark secrets to just anyone… Luckily, you can be anyone you want to be.The game features more than 1600 full HD video responses, a simple questioning interface with unique ‘delete’ mechanic, and a randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Developed by the World Record-breaking makers of \"The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker\".● Shapeshift - into nine other characters so you can investigate and manipulate relationships from all angles, and unlock the other half of the story.● Suspense - solve a murder, stop a murder, don’t get caught. Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers.● Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships – or don’t.● Problem solving - can’t get that vital clue yourself? Try shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options are a trap? Delete them. ● 100% FMV - an entire game of smooth FMV cutscenes and responses in first person perspective.● Catalytic events - not all branching is binary.
