The game is made by Telehorse, a steampunk games company. It was awarded the Best Upcoming Game at IMGA in San Francisco in March 2017.The main character, professor Vincent Cornelius Moore, fights robots that invaded the city of Steamburg. The gameplay is unique – Vincent is unarmed, so he must choose his moves wisely. He can only throw small electro-bombs which lure the robots and halt their progress for a while. Vincent has to walk through the streets in such a way that the robot chasing him hits upon a Tesla coil and is destroyed. It seems quite easy in the first levels. Then you have to fight several robots at the same time, the robots become faster and faster, some of them can fly and other respond to Vincent’s every move.Narrative elements are of great importance. In 2016 Steamburg won an award for Best Storytelling at White Nights in Helsinki. Dialogues reveal Vincent to be a scientist responsible for testing a new weapon in Steamburg. At the same time he is searching for his fiancée who was reported to be in Steamburg when the robots attacked. Some narrative elements are connected directly with the gameplay. Players can also find many letters and photos and discover the love story of Vincent and his fiancée.Features:• Unique, addictive gameplay• 32 levels set in atmospheric steampunk locations• Several hidden locations and dozens of narrative objects to be explored• Outstanding American and British voice actors including Bruce Glover (known for Diamonds Are Forever and Chinatown)• Original score by Silver Rocket ","game_category":"Adventure, Puzzle, Action","release_date":"2018-11-22","agerating":"e10","isTotalCh":0,"publisher":"Monster Couch","developer":"Telehorse","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian","required_space":"2.4 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050709","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/steamburg-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050709","type":"image"}],"idx":2883},{"name":"Steamroll: Rustless Edition","nameEn":"Steamroll: Rustless Edition","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/steamroll-rustless-edition-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000032007","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"In this steampunk setting, you will play as a young engineer on his first day of work. A young man finding a job? As you can see, everything is possible in video games! The problem is that the mine you work on is about to collapse. Luckily, this budding engineer has the Scarabeus, a steam-powered, rolling vehicle that is loaded with qualities. And he will need all of them because just before starting his escape he realizes that there are other people trapped in that mining hell.At the controls of his incredible machine, the protagonist will be able to explore the environment and solve the puzzles that block his way. As it happens with mini-golf, that involves aiming and measuring your trajectory with precision. You will also have to use different steam balls to solve many challenging puzzles. Thanks to these balls you can cause explosions to destroy obstacles or create ramps and walls in order to have an easier time down there. There is no doubt that the Scarabeus will be a vital ally in escaping alive from the depths of the mine.

Everyone fled the cities, mass panic in the streets. The zombies took over our towns, our buildings, our houses. Now we sleep outside while they roam our streets.We waited for the army, and the army didn’t come, so we picked up guns. We waited for a hero, and noone came, so we were left to survive on our own. Now we’re done waiting. Will you lead us in the face of a certain doom?We’ve organized into hunting parties, to take our blocks back and push the evil residents away. We officially declare that from today onwards, our city is a Zero Z Zone. We’re the Zombie Blast Crew.Planning and getting the proper crew and equipment is already half the battle. No hero gets through a battle without his sword, and no crew member goes to the field without their gun. Big crowd of walking dead? Karen and her flamethrower got you covered. Need to keep your distance from certain stupid zombies? Michael’s assault rifle or Javier’s machine gun might be a better pick. It’s all about using your head, knowing your craft and picking the right man or woman for the right job.Same goes for our gear. Do you pack a scout med-kit to heal after-zombie injuries? Some grenades to clear infected areas? Some food to get yourself a hunter survival boost? Don’t rush in, it pays to be prepared.
