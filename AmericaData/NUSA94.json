The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging.The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.Ever wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routineSave Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell! It's not the place it used to be - Hell's been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They've turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What's in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.Choose the right side of evil and rescue your \"princess\" - the most badass dare-deviless Hell has ever seen.The game contains graphic violence, blood and gore.","game_category":"Action, Role-Playing, Action, Party","release_date":"2019-10-10","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Big Way","developer":null,"no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, English","required_space":"4.0 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050707","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/bdsm-big-drunk-satanic-massacre-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050707","type":"image"}],"idx":4650},{"name":"BE-A Walker","nameEn":"BE-A Walker","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/be-a-walker-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$9.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000027642","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"You are the pilot of a battle mech BE-A Walker (Biped Enhanced Assault Walker).

However, when new enemies and hazards appear, the game pauses to allow you to plan your reaction to this new change.

Choose wisely as your progression through the game will affect not only soldiers you command but also a whole region and everyone who happen to live here. But you should also keep in mind that your soldiers have their own opinion on what is good for the squad so you have to maintain a balance between what you want them to do and what is good for keeping the squad in high spirits.“Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road maybe; for without victory, there is no survival.”― Winston Churchill","game_category":"Role-Playing, Strategy, Action, Other","release_date":"2020-04-23","agerating":"m","isTotalCh":1,"publisher":"Super.com","developer":"Porta Play","no_of_players":"1 player","supported_languages":"English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese","required_space":"4.1 GB","play_mode_tv_mode_b":true,"play_mode_handheld_mode_b":true,"play_mode_tabletop_mode_b":true,"club_nintendo":false,"cloud_saves_b":true,"imgList":[{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot01?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot02?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot03?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot04?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_585/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot05?v=2021050711","type":"image"},{"thumb":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_283/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","img":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/ncom/en_US/games/switch/b/broken-lines-switch/screenshot-gallery/screenshot06?v=2021050711","type":"image"}],"idx":4678},{"name":"Brotherhood United","nameEn":"Brotherhood United","url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/brotherhood-united-switch/","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"$8.99","specialPrice":"暂无优惠","specialDate":"暂无优惠","platform":"Switch","nsuid":"70010000027743","platform2":"Nintendo Switch","desc":"When the time of crisis comes and one of your friends is captured, you gotta stand your ground and fight for your partners.
